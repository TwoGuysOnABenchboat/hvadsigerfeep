            <h1>Liminal Brutalis: PA - Update #3 - A colorful approach</h1>
            <p class="blog-post-date">February 9, 2026</p>
            <p>This sprint I'm working on quite a "colorful" area of the game. A stark contrast to the otherwise sterile, grey (Brutalistic) world of Liminal Brutalis. But don't be fooled, this place is not for leisure.</p>
            <p>Here is a few of the funky assets!</p>
            <img class="blog-post-media" src="blogpostMedia1_2026_09_02.png" alt="Blog">
            <p>Fun fact! Every single asset uses a single 124x124 index-texture. This of course means that I have to "texture" the assets with color-assigned-UV-islands; which increases the poly-count slightly, but what we lose in pristine mesh optimization, we gain in draw-calls and texture memory.  </p>

            <p>They're are also a ton of fun to make and — In my opinion — gain a lot of personality simply as a consequence of this workflow.</p>
