                <h1>Liminal Brutalis: First Devlog (Test)</h1>
                <p class="blog-post-date">February 4, 2026</p>
                <p>
                    Welcome to the first devlog for Liminal Brutalis. This is where we will share progress, images, and
                    notes as the game evolves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is also <i>(mostly)</i> a way to test the new 'Blog' section of the site, and see how it handles
                    multiple posts. So this one is a bit bare-boned. More interesting stuff will follow soon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What is <b>Liminal Brutalis: PA (Physical Agility)?</b> In short; It's a first-person precision platformer.
                    We are focusing on traversal, rhythm, and crunchy "movement tech".
                </p>
                <p>
                    I grew up on a heavy diet of games rooted in Source. Playing HL1 & HL2, custom traversal maps I
                    developed a taste of that very specific flow of movement. You know which one.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>LB:PA</b> Is my love-letter to those games.There are, however, more tricks to LB:PA than just a
                    responsive control-scheme, I'm building a rich world ("The Facility"), soaked in dark lore <i>(For
                    those who care about that)</i> for you to explore and conqure.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In addition to a hand-crafted, detailed world, I wanted LB:PA to stand out a bit from your regular
                    precision jumper. So I'm handing you — wait for it — <b>JUICE!</b>
                    <img class="inline-emote" src="../../../../Graphics/Emotes/bb_Happy.png" alt=":happy:" />
                    The vending machine juices act as punchy powerups—small boosts that let you chain movement, recover,
                    or push through tougher sections.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These delish packs of goodness can be powerful if used right. While they wont grand you super-powers
                    — and they are not endless — a tiny bit of extra juice at the right time can change a doomed run to
                    a beautiful one. They may also help show the way to... secrets? Oh boy
                </p>
