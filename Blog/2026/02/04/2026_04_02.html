                <p>
                    Welcome to the first devlog for <b>Liminal Brutalis: Physical Agility</b>. This is where we will share progress, images, and
                    notes as the game evolves.<img class="inline-emote" src="../../../../Graphics/Emotes/bb_Beer.png" alt=":beer:" />

                <p>
                    This <i>(mostly)</i> a way to test the new 'Blog' section of the site, and see how it handles
                    multiple posts. So this one is a bit bare-boned. More interesting stuff will follow soon.<img class="inline-emote" src="../../../../Graphics/Emotes/bb_Cool.png" alt=":beer:" />

                <p>
                    What is <b>Liminal Brutalis: PA (Physical Agility)?</b> In short; It's a first-person precision platformer.
                    We are focusing on traversal, rhythm, and crunchy "movement tech".
                </p>
                <p>
                    I grew up on a <b>heavy </b>diet of games rooted in <b>Source</b>. Playing HL1 &amp; HL2, custom <i>traversal </i>maps I
                    developed a taste of that very specific flow of movement. You know which one.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>LB:PA</b> Is my love-letter to those games. There are, however, more tricks to LB:PA than just a
                    responsive control-scheme, and crates to jump on. <br>I'm building a rich world ("The Facility"), soaked in dark lore <i>(For
                    those who care about that)</i> for you to explore and conquer.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In addition to a hand-crafted, detailed world, I wanted <b>LB:PA</b> to stand out a bit from your regular
                    precision jumper. Therefore I'm handing you — wait for it — <b>JUICE!</b>
                    <img class="inline-emote" src="../../../../Graphics/Emotes/bb_Happy.png" alt=":happy:">
                    The vending machine "juices" <i>(Don't ask what's in them)</i> act as punchy powerups—small boosts that let you chain movement, recover,
                    or push through tougher sections.
                </p>
                <p>While they wont exactly grand you super-powers
                    — <i>and won't make you a better player sorry</i> — a tiny bit of extra juice at the right time can quickly change a doomed run to the perfect one. If you know how to use them. <br><br>They may also help show the way to... <i>secrets</i>? Oh boy
                </p>
