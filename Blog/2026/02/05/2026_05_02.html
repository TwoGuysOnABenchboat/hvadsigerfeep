            <p class="blog-post-date">February 5, 2026</p>
            <p>So, I finally gabe the Bench Boat Games site a clean-up! This includes additions such as the brand new 'BLOG' section (Which you are reading right now wow!) and a offical page for 'Liminal Brutalis: Physical Agility' a game which has been in progress for quite some time now.</p> 
            <p>I also made the decision to "reveal" the first 'Teaser trailer' I made for it 2 years ago. More on that later </p>

            <p>On another note, I've slowly been working towards something that resembles a proper Discord server, with that ofcorse comes a roster of "Bench Boat Games exclusive" Emotes.</p>
            <img class="blog-post-media" src="blogpostMedia1_2026_05_02.png" alt="Emotes">
            <p>The server is still closed for private invites only while we test it.</p>
            <img class="blog-post-media" src="blogpostMedia2_2026_05_02.png" alt="Discord">
            <p>On that note, thanks for reading the Third (Probably first, real, post). I'm still trying to figure out how to best set this up, It's all manual .html right now lol.
